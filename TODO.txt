- [X] Parse Bracken report files
- [ ] Display data from both files
- [ ] Parse sample_data file to group samples together
    - [ ] standard file for experiment
- [ ] Add filter options
    - [ ] taxa level
    - [ ] read count
    - [ ] etc.
- [ ] Compute other stats from it
- [ ] Compare samples
- [ ] export tree and data to newick file 
    - [ ] and other formats http://yulab-smu.top/treedata-book/chapter1.html
- [ ] instead of concatenating trees from the brack/kraken file, use external phylogenetic tree (revamp indent as distance, use )
