This is a work in progress. The commands may change between released versions, please read the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG).

## Goals

The first goal of this project is to convert Kraken reports into standard file formats that can be easily read with R to allow people to craft thier own data visualisations and compute statistics more easily using the tidyverse, vegan, ape, and ggtree/treeio. The second goal is to get summary information from the Kraken reports directly from the command line.

Supports Kraken reports from [Kraken2](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2) or from [Bracken](https://github.com/jenniferlu717/Bracken).
